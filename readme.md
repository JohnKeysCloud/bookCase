A library application that stores a user's reading list built for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. The goal of the project was to implement a JavaScript object constructor that would create "Book" instances from which to inherit keys & methods. The "Book" instances are stored in an array and used to populate the contents of the bookcase via a neat CSS3 grid trick (see code). The application currently saves users' reading lists through the use of local storage.

I simultaneously designed and authored the webpage using using vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Notes
I based the design of the project on neumorphism, a form of minimalism characterized by a soft and light look where elements are usually the same color as the background and are only distinguishable by shadows and highlights surrounding the element. I feel this gives it a modern aesthetic. 

My favorite part of building this project was going the extra mile of creating its visually pleasing, dynamically responsive UX/UI.

I hope you like it! ^_^
