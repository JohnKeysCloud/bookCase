A library application that stores a user's reading listâ€¦ built for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. The goal of this project was to implement a JavaScript object constructor that would create "Book" instances and inherit keys & methods. The "Book" instances are stored in an array and used to populate the contents of the bookcase with the help of a neat CSS3 grid trick (see code).

The application currently saves users' reading lists through the use of local storage.

I simultaneously designed and programmed the page using using vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Notes
I based my design on neumorphism, a form of minimalism characterized by a soft and light look where elements are usually the same color as the background and are only distinguishable by shadwos and highlights surrounding the element. I feel this gives off a modern aesthetic. 

My favorite part of authoring this project was going the extra mile of designing and building a visually pleasing UX/UI for the application, seeing as most submissions were lacking.

I hope you like it! ^_^
